## Project Structure

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.dev/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just an extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

Inside your project, you'll see the following directory structure:

```
├── public/
│   └── ...
└── src/
    ├── components/
    │   └── ...
    └── routes/
        └── ...
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory-based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and an `index.tsx` file as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.dev/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

## Add Integrations and deployment

Use the `npm run qwik add` command to add additional integrations. Some examples of integrations includes: Cloudflare, Netlify or Express Server, and the [Static Site Generator (SSG)](https://qwik.dev/qwikcity/guides/static-site-generation/).

```shell
npm run qwik add # or `yarn qwik add`
```

## Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). The `dev` command will server-side render (SSR) the output during development.

```shell
# Magichub — Landpage (Qwik)

Landpage para o MVP do `Magichub` — template criado com Qwik City e Tailwind.

Setup local

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build para GitHub Pages

```bash
# Constrói o site e copia a saída para `docs/` (pasta usada pelo GitHub Pages)
npm run build && cp -r dist docs || true
# Depois commit/push e habilite GitHub Pages apontando para a pasta `docs/` na branch `main`.
```

Personalização

- Edite `src/routes/index.tsx` para alterar textos e placeholders.
- Edite `src/global.css` e `tailwind.config.cjs` para ajustar cores e tipografia.

Assets

- Placeholders SVG estão em `src/assets/`.
